# Downloads the upstream OpenAPI spec into a temp dir, then hands it to
# provider-dev/scripts/record_spec_pin.mjs which applies the deterministic
# fix classes, validates with @apidevtools/swagger-parser, redacts
# credential-shaped example values, verifies the result against
# provider-dev/config/spec_pin.json and only then writes the snapshot into
# provider-dev/downloaded/.
#
# If the download does not match the recorded pin the script fails without
# writing anything; pass --update to accept the upstream change and rewrite
# the pin (treat the resulting spec diff as a reviewed refresh - run
# .claude/skills/stackql-provider-development/scripts/spec_diff.mjs on the
# old and new snapshots and record the summary in NOTES.md).
#
# SPEC_URL and SPEC_FILE come from provider-dev/scripts/lib/spec_helpers.mjs
# (the single source of provider constants). A vendor with several
# documents: call record_spec_pin.mjs once per document (each pins under
# specs.<name>).
#
# Usage: bin/fetch-spec.sh [--update]
